Review,Label
A true masterpiece if you enjoy three-hour-long naps.,1
"Fantastic CGI, almost as if they hired a toddler with crayons.",1
"Brilliant acting, especially if you're into wooden mannequins.",1
The plot was so unpredictable; I fell asleep from the suspense.,1
A must-watch for those who love movies that make absolutely no sense.,1
Worst movie ever! I loved every excruciating minute of it.,0
The director clearly aimed for 'so bad it's good' but landed on 'just plain terrible.',0
Incredible how every actor managed to forget their lines at the same time.,0
I laughed so hard at the dialogues; I cried tears of regret.,0
"A cinematic experience you won't forget, no matter how desperately you try.",0
